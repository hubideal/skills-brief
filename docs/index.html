					<h3>***Short description goes here***</h3>
					<p>President Donald Trump has said several times since becoming president that he wants our immigration system to be based more on merit. For those less familiar with our immigration system, his comments obscure a very real trend that has emerged in recent years: That the migrants coming to our country through legal channels today are already strikingly more educated than generations past. In 2017, more than three out of every five of such immigrants (aged 25 and above) had either a bachelor’s degree or graduate-level education. In 1980, just 15.7 percent of all U.S. immigrants in that age band had that level of education. </p>
		
					<p id="intro_last_p">Recent immigrants, however, are not just well educated, they often bring skills U.S. employers desperately need as well. To understand how immigrants are addressing challenges in our workforce—from a shortage of medical professionals to a need for more engineers—we analyzed 2017 data on recent immigrants, or those who had arrived in the country within the last year. These new Americans prove to be incredibly well-positioned to fill persistently-vacant positions in our economy, allowing U.S. employers to expand and create jobs for Americans at all skill levels. </p>

						<h3>Immigrants entering the United States through legal channels are highly-educated.</h3>
						<p>While those with a high school education or below made up the vast majority of adult immigrants as recently as 1980, the most common level of education among the recent immigrants we studied was a bachelor’s degree, followed closely by graduate-level education.</p>
					</div>
					<div class='step2' data-step='3'>
						<h3>Recent immigrants to the United States often arrive with the STEM training U.S. employers need.</h3>
						<p>Employers in recent years have faced a dire shortage of workers with expertise in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (or STEM). As recently as 2016, 13 open STEM jobs were posted online for every one unemployed STEM worker. A large number of recent immigrants have degrees in these fields. </p>

					<div class='step2' data-step='5'>
						<h3>Recent immigrants often work in fields with known labor shortages.</h3>
						<p>STEM jobs are not the only ones difficult to fill. In some parts of the country struggle to find enough doctors and nurses to care for the rapidly-aging Baby Boomer population. One NAE study, for instance, found that 135 counties in the United States—often rural ones with large health challenges—lack a single active physician. Researchers also predict the United States will be short more than 900,000 nurses by 2030.</p>

						<h3>Newly arrived immigrants are good news for America’s engineering shortage.</h3>
						<p>In 2017, recent immigrants were almost four times more likely than the U.S.-born population to work as engineers. These more than 13,000 professionals are invaluable to U.S. employers trying to expand and base operations in America: One recent study found that 82 percent of employers hiring engineers in 2016 anticipated they would have serious trouble finding enough qualified workers.</p>

						<h3>Today’s immigrants are not just filling our workforce gaps, they are helping to educate the next generation of American workers.</h3>
						<p>The top occupation for recently-arrived legal immigrants in 2017 was postsecondary educator, or college professor. Recent immigrants, in fact, made up roughly one out of every 11 college professors in 2017. Immigrants have long played a major role in generating intellectual capital: More than three out of every four patents awarded to the top 10 most productive U.S. research universities in recent years have had at least one foreign-born inventor. Such patents often generate revenue for universities and spark the creation of new businesses and opportunities on U.S. soil. </p>

					<h3>The bottom line is simple.</h3>
					<p>America’s electorate is rapidly changing, particularly in swing districts. Although districts will be redrawn in many states after 2020, the demographic changes are so significant and inevitable that both parties will need to adapt to them. This has serious implications for politicians who have relied on anti-immigrant messages to appeal to voters. <a href=https://research.newamericaneconomy.org/report/election-recap-2018-demographics-and-education-levels-in-flipped-districts target=_blank>As NAE has found before</a>, candidates will find it harder to convince increasingly diverse and college-educated electorates to vote for them with xenophobic platforms.</p>
					<p>Of course, our 2024 figures are not written in the stars. After all, immigrant voters could well reverse recent electoral trends and vote for more Republican candidates. However, this is unlikely without Republicans embracing more inclusive rhetoric and championing the kind of sensible immigration reforms that are <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/01/11/americans-dont-want-trumps-border-wall-heres-what-they-think-should-happen-instead/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7211b1fe722c" target="_blank">supported by the majority of Americans</a>.</p>
